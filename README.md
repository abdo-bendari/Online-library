# About 

This project is an online public library that allows users to explore a wide range of books. Users can either register as regular users or authors. Regular users can browse the library, view different authors, and search for books or specific authors. They can also search for an author and see all the books they've written. Authors, on the other hand, can register to gain additional privileges, such as adding new books to the library, editing or deleting their books, and updating their personal information. This platform is designed to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, allowing authors to present their works and giving users easy access to a variety of books.
